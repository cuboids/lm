members <- readRDS(file = "original_df.rds")
```

First we shall select the subset of data that we want to use, i.e. filter out certain years and peaks 

```{r}
#Summary table for peaks with their death rates
Peak_summary <- members %>% 
  group_by(peak_id) %>%
  summarise(climbs = n(), death_rate = sum(died)) %>%
  arrange(climbs %>% desc()) 

Avg_Death_Rate <- sum(members$died) / nrow(members) #all peaks combined
AB_line_df_x <- head(c(1:9 %o% 10^(0:4)), -6) #remove last 6 for graphing purposes
AB_line_df_y <- head(c(1:9 %o% 10^(0:4)), -6) * Avg_Death_Rate


#Plot of Death vs number of climbs for the different peak
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = Peak_summary, aes(x = climbs, y = death_rate), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = AB_line_df_x, y = AB_line_df_y)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1000, color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans=scales::pseudo_log_trans(base = 10)) + 
  xlab("Number of Climbs") +
  ylab("Deaths")

Peak_Id_subset <- Peak_summary$peak_id[Peak_summary$climbs >= 1000] #subset used, arbitrary set to 1000

filter1_members <- members %>%
  filter(peak_id %in% Peak_Id_subset)

```



```{r}
#Summary table for death rate changes over time
Year_Summary <- filter1_members %>%
  filter(year > 1950) %>% #apart from 1957 have every year post 1950, whereas pre-1950 there are considerably gaps
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(climbs = n(), death_rate = sum(died)/climbs)

#Plot of Death Rate vs year
ggplot(data = Year_Summary, aes(x = year, y = death_rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  #geom_smooth(size = .4, se = FALSE) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1990, color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Death Rate")


filtered_members <- filter1_members %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)
#add legend
#cross check selected and first climbs 
```
