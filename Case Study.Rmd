We'll define a couple more variables we can use in the logit models.

```{r}
expeditions$staff_share = expeditions$hired_staff/(expeditions$members + expeditions$hired_staff)
expeditions$staff_share_laplace = (expeditions$hired_staff + 1)/(expeditions$members + expeditions$hired_staff + 2)

mixed_gender <- logical(nrow(expeditions))
for (i in 1:nrow(expeditions)) {
  mixed_gender[[i]] <- members[members$expedition_id == expeditions$expedition_id[[i]], ] %>%
    filter(hired == "FALSE") %>%
    .$sex %>%
    .[!is.na(.)] %>%
    unique() %>%
    length() %>%
    if (. == 2) TRUE else if (. != 1) NA
}; rm(i)

mixed_citizenship <- logical(nrow(expeditions))
for (i in 1:nrow(expeditions)) {
  mixed_citizenship[[i]] <- members[members$expedition_id == expeditions$expedition_id[[i]], ] %>%
    filter(hired == "FALSE") %>%
    .$citizenship %>%
    .[!is.na(.)] %>%
    unique() %>%
    length() %>%
    if (. >=2 ) TRUE
}; rm(i)

expeditions$mixed_gender <- mixed_gender
expeditions$mixed_citizenship <- mixed_citizenship

# We need to rearrange expeditions to add n_previous_ascends.
expeditions <- expeditions %>%
  arrange(year, peak_id) %>%
  group_by(peak_id)

expeditions$n_previous_ascends <- rep(0, times = nrow(expeditions))

for (i in 1:nrow(expeditions)) {
  if (expeditions$termination_reason[[i]] == "Success (main peak)") {
    peak_id = expeditions$peak_id[[i]]
    for (j in i:nrow(expeditions)) {
      if (expeditions$peak_id[[j]] == peak_id) {
        expeditions$n_previous_ascends[[j]] = expeditions$n_previous_ascends[[j]] + 1
      }
    }
    if (i %% 100 == 0) print(paste(round(i/100), "%"))
  }
}; rm(i, j)

expeditions <- expeditions %>% left_join(select(peaks, height_metres, peak_id), 
                          by = "peak_id", copy = TRUE)

expeditions$base2high <- expeditions$highpoint_date - expeditions$basecamp_date

# Check if columns have been defined correctly.
(colnames(expeditions)[17:23] == c("staff_share", "staff_share_laplace", "mixed_gender",
                                  "mixed_citizenship", "n_previous_ascends", "base2high",
                                  "height_metres")) %>% all()
```

Data exploration based on the Tidy Tuesday screencast (https://youtu.be/WT7FMn-_jPY)

```{r}
peaks %>%
  arrange(desc(height_metres)) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  mutate(peak_name = fct_reorder(peak_name, height_metres)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(height_metres, peak_name, fill = climbing_status)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Height (meters)",
       y = "",
       title = "Tallest Himalayan Peaks")

expeditions %>%
  group_by(peak_name) %>%
  summarize(n_climbs = n(),
            across(members:hired_staff_deaths, sum),
            first_climb = min(year)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_climbs)) %>%
  head(11) %>%
  ggplot(aes(peak_name, n_climbs)) +
  geom_col()
```
Let's try to fit a linear model for Kangchenjunga

```{r}
expeditions[expeditions$peak_name == "Kangchenjunga", ]

expeditions %>%
  filter(peak_name == "Kangchenjunga") %>%
  mutate(termination_reason = factor(termination_reason)) %>%
  group_by(termination_reason) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

expeditions %>%
  filter(peak_name == "Kangchenjunga") %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)

members[members$expedition_id == "KANG91102", ]

# Make a LM suitable tibble for Kangchenjunga

kangchenjunga <- members %>%
  left_join(expeditions, by = c("peak_id", "expedition_id", "year", "season", "peak_name"), 
            suffix = c(".m", ".e")) %>%
  add_column(., leader_or_climber = (grepl("Leader", .$expedition_role, TRUE) |
                                     grepl("Climber", .$expedition_role, TRUE))) %>%
  filter(peak_name == "Kangchenjunga",
         year >= 1990,
         hired == "FALSE") %>%
  select(died, success, expedition_id, member_id, year, season, sex, age, expedition_role,
         leader_or_climber, solo, oxygen_used.m, staff_share_laplace, mixed_gender,
         mixed_citizenship, n_previous_ascends, base2high, height_metres)

kangchenjunga %>% filter(leader_or_climber == TRUE)

```


No clue what's below! Haha

```{r}
